        <h2>Revitalizing Dr. Strassmann's Digital Legacy</h2>
        <h2>The Problem: A Outdated Research Website</h2>
        <p>
            Dr. Strassmann's groundbreaking research in Biological Anthropology was overshadowed by an outdated website
             that lacked clear navigation, accessibility, and engagement. Key problems included:
        </p>
            <p>
                - Lack of visibility for research collaborators and ongoing projects.
            </p>
            <p> - Poor readability and organization, making it difficult for students and researchers to explore her work.
            </p>

        <p> 
             -Outdated design, failing to reflect the impact of her contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal was to create a modern, accessible, and research-focused
          website that accurately represents her contributions and makes her
          work more discoverable to both academic and public audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities
          Program and culminated in a final research poster at the University of
          Michigan's Spring Symposium, where I presented insights on designing
          effective academic websites.

        <h2>Process: A Collaborative, Iterative Approach</h2>
        <p>
            To ensure the final design met both <strong>academic and usability standards </strong>, we followed a structured yet flexible approach:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Key Challenge:</strong> Teachers had varying levels of
            technological expertise, so the tool had to be
            <strong>extremely simple to use</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Content Strategy & Research - </strong> Identified key sections: Research Areas, People, Publications, and Contact.          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wireframing & Prototyping - </strong> Designed initial layouts in Figma based on user needs
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Iterative Feedback & Refinement - </strong>  Reviewed progress with Dr. Strassmann, refining the structure and design.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessibility & Visual Optimization - </strong> Adjusted color contrast, typography, and layout to meet usability standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Final Implementation - </strong> Developed the website using WordPress, ensuring a seamless user experience.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Design Elements</h2>
        <p>
          In the first iteration of prototyping we focused on updating the content and creating a basic updated layout. 
          We did not focus as much on the color and aesthetics as we wanted to havea MVP website for Dr. Strassmann before
           a confrence she attended. We understood that the color pallette that we generated was lackign in vibrancy however, 
           we determined that updating the infromation was more important as people would be visiting her website to learn
           more about her.

        </div>
        <p>
            In the second iteration of prototyping we focused on updating UI elements (including color pallette) and reducing the wordiness of the wesite.
            We wanted users to be able to recieve a general overview of her research with the option to dig deeper into her work optionally.
            This casued a larger focus on refining the research areas as user testing showed that the research section was overly wordy. 
            Explaining the research can create a dense large chunk of text, which we reduced in the next iteration.

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                This project was my first in-depth experience with academic website design, blending user experience principles with academic integrity. 
                <br><strong>Key takeaways:</strong><br>
                 <strong>Collaboration is key -</strong> Regular feedback cycles with Dr. Strassmann helped refine the design. <br>
                <strong>Iteration leads to improvement- </strong> designs weren't perfect, but continuous refinements led to a strong final product. <br>
                <strong>Simplicity enhances usability - </strong>A clean, organized layout makes complex research more accessible. <br>
                By prioritizing clarity, accessibility, and academic rigor, we transformed Dr. Strassmann's website into an engaging, user-friendly platform that truly reflects her research legacy.

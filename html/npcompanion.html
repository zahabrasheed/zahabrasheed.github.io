            <h1>NP Nurse Companion Project</h1>
            <section class="project-description">
                <p>The NP Nurse Companion project is an ongoing initiative in collaboration with the Michigan School of Nursing, aiming to support newly qualified Nurse Practitioners (NPs) during their transition into practice. High turnover rates among NPs within their first year are often attributed to a lack of support and mentorship. To address this issue, our team is developing a web-based, mobile-first application that facilitates mentorship and provides relevant resources.</p>

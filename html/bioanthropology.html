            <h2>Revitalizing Dr. Strassmann's Digital Legacy</h2>
            <h3>The Problem: Dr. Strassmann's research in Biological Anthropology was overshadowed by an outdated website
              that lacked clear navigation, accessibility, and engagement.</h3>

          Key problems included:

        </ul>
            <li>
              Lack of visibility for research collaborators and ongoing projects.
            </li>
            <li> Poor readability and organization, making it difficult for students and researchers to explore her work.
            </li>
            

        <li> 
            Outdated design, failing to reflect the impact of her contributions.

          Solution: Create a modern, accessible, and research-focused
          website that accurately represents her contributions and makes her
          work more discoverable to both academic and public audiences.

          This project was part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities
          Program and culminated in a final research poster at the University of
          Michigan's Spring Symposium, where I presented insights on designing
          effective academic websites.

        <h2>Process: A Collaborative, Iterative Approach</h2>
        <p>
            To ensure the final design met both <strong>academic and usability standards </strong>, we followed a structured yet flexible approach:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Content Strategy & Research - </strong> Identified key sections: Research Areas, People, Publications, and Contact.          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wireframing & Prototyping - </strong> Designed initial layouts in Figma based on user needs
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Iterative Feedback & Refinement - </strong>  Reviewed progress with Dr. Strassmann, refining the structure and design.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessibility & Visual Optimization - </strong> Adjusted color contrast, typography, and layout to meet usability standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Final Implementation - </strong> Developed the website using WordPress, ensuring a seamless user experience.

        <h2>Key Design Elements</h2>
        <p>
          In the first iteration of prototyping we focused on updating the content and creating a basic updated layout. 
          We did not focus as much on the color and aesthetics as we wanted to have a MVP website for Dr. Strassmann before
           a confrence she attended. Although we were unsatisfied with the colors chosen, we focused more on content than UI at this stage. 
        </p>

        <img src="/assets/prototype-bis/iteration1.png" alt="iteration 1">
              <p class="caption"> 
                In the first iteration of prototyping, we prioritized content strategy and developed a streamlined, 
                user-friendly layout. Rather than focusing on visual hierarchy and UI aesthetics, our goal was to 
                create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) website for Dr. Strassmann ahead of an important conference. 
                While we were unsatisfied with the color palette and overall UI consistency, we focused on information 
                architecture and ensuring content accessibility at this stage.

            <img src="/assets/prototype-bis/iteration2.png" alt="iteration 2">
                  <p class="caption"> 
                    In the second iteration of prototyping, we focused on refining UI elements, including the color palette, 
                    and making the website more concise. Our goal was to give users a clear overview of Dr. Strassmann's 
                    research while allowing them to explore deeper if they chose to. Based on user testing, 
                    we streamlined the research section, as it was overly wordy. Explaining the research naturally 
                    led to dense blocks of text, which we condensed in the next iteration for better readability and engagement.

                      <p class="caption"> 
                        When refining the color palette, we wanted to pay homage to Mali and the location 
                        of Dr. Strassmann's research, making the website feel more cohesive with the 
                        photographs we planned to feature from her travels. We chose a terracotta shade 
                        to reflect the reddish tones of the ground, creating a more natural and connected visual experience.

            <h2>Final Thoughts and Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p>
                 <strong>Collaboration is key -</strong> Regular feedback cycles with Dr. Strassmann helped refine the design. <br>
                <strong>Iteration leads to improvement- </strong> designs weren't perfect, but continuous refinements led to a strong final product. <br>
                <strong>Simplicity enhances usability - </strong>A clean, organized layout makes complex research more accessible. <br>
                By prioritizing clarity, accessibility, and academic rigor, we transformed Dr. Strassmann's website into an engaging, user-friendly platform that truly reflects her research legacy.

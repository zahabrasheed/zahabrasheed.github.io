          <h2>The Problem: A Broken System for Behavior Tracking</h2>
          <p>
            Teachers at Mahad Al Zahra struggled with an outdated system—an
            Excel sheet—to track student behavior. The result? Inconsistent
            reporting, frustrated parents, and teachers unable to provide clear,
            objective insights. Parents often doubted reports, unsure if
            teachers were exaggerating or downplaying their child's behavior.
            This lack of transparency eroded trust between educators and
            families.
          </p>
          <p>
            We needed a better way: A seamless, reliable platform that required
            minimal technical skills and kept all stakeholders informed.

      <section class="approach">
        <h2>Our Approach: Building a Simple Yet Powerful Tool</h2>
        <p>
          To solve this, we designed the
          <strong>Hogwarts Style Point Tracker</strong>, a web application that
          allows teachers to log both positive and negative behaviors in real
          time, automatically generating clear reports for parents.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Key Challenge:</strong> Teachers had varying levels of
            technological expertise, so the tool had to be
            <strong>extremely simple to use</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Research:</strong> We conducted interviews with teachers to understand their frustrations and needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Core Design Decisions:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A <strong>one-page form</strong> for quick behavior tracking.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Mobile-first design</strong> for easy access.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Automated reporting</strong> to ensure accuracy and
                transparency.

        <p>
          Initially, we assumed the system would primarily be for only logging.
          However, feedback revealed that teachers wanted the ability to
          <strong>engage students in healthy competition.</strong> They also wanted to send reports and look at student behavior ovet time. 
          This led us to create a <strong>user friendly reports page</strong>, with automated emailing capability to parents.

          Although full implementation is still in progress, early feedback

            <strong>Ease of Use Score:</strong> Positive preliminary responses

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Report accuracy expected to improve</strong>, reducing
            inconsistencies in student records.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Increased parent trust</strong>, with initial feedback
            praising clarity and transparency.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Moving forward, we plan to integrate
          <strong>fully automated</strong> monthly emails to refine the platform further and
          ensure it continues to meet user needs.

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              This project was all about finding the right balance between user experience and
               functionality. By keeping things simple, transparent, and efficient, we built a tool 
               that can really improve communication between teachers and parents, making student behavior 
               tracking clearer and more trustworthy. This was also my first time working in the UI/UX space, 
               and it pushed me to think differently—not just about how I build things, 
               but about how design and software work together to shape the way people interact with technology.

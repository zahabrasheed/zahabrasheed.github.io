          <h2>Mahad al Zahra Conduct Tracker</h2>
          <h3>The Problem: Teachers at Mahad Al Zahra struggled with an outdated systemâ€”an
            Excel sheetâ€”to track student behavior.</h2>
          <p>
             The result? Inconsistent
            reporting, frustrated parents, and teachers unable to provide clear,
            objective insights. Parents often doubted reports, unsure if
            teachers were exaggerating or downplaying their child's behavior.
            This lack of transparency eroded trust between educators and
            families.

        <h2>Our Approach: Building a Simple Yet Powerful Tool</h2>
        <h3>
          We designed the
          <strong>Hogwarts Style Point Tracker</strong>, a web application that
          allows teachers to log both positive and negative behaviors in real
          time, automatically generating clear reports for parents.
        </h3><ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Key Challenge:</strong> Teachers had varying levels of technological expertise, so the tool had to be 
            <strong>extremely simple to use</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Research:</strong> We conducted interviews with teachers to understand their frustrations and needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Core Design Decisions:</strong>
            <span>Key choices that shaped the tool:</span> 
            <ul class = "nested-list">
              <li>A <strong>one-page form</strong> for quick behavior tracking.</li>
              <li><strong>Mobile-first design</strong> for easy access.</li>
              <li><strong>Automated reporting</strong> to ensure accuracy and transparency.</li>

                focusing only on the essential data.

                I added a real-time leaderboard to boost engagement and built an authentication

          Although full implementation is still in progress, early feedback
          suggests significant improvements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>High teacher adoption potential</strong>, based on usability
            testing.

          <li>
            <strong>Ease of Use Score:</strong> Positive preliminary responses
            from teachers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Report accuracy expected to improve</strong>, reducing

        </ul>
        <p>
          Moving forward, we plan to integrate
          <strong>fully automated</strong> monthly emails to refine the platform further and
          ensure it continues to meet user needs.

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              This project was all about finding the right balance between user experience and
               functionality. By keeping things simple, transparent, and efficient, we built a tool 
               that can really improve communication between teachers and parents, making student behavior 
               tracking clearer and more trustworthy. This was also my first time working in the UI/UX space, 
               and it pushed me to think differentlyâ€”not just about how I build things, 
               but about how design and software work together to shape the way people interact with technology.

                <h2>NP Companion - A Mentorship App for Nurse Practitioners</h2>
                <h3>Many new NPs struggle with a lack of structured support and 
                    mentorship in their field. However, they are already overwhelmed with demanding 
                    workloads. </h3>
                    <p>Although I can't share the designs due to an NDA and the project's development stage,
                         I can walk you through the key design decisions we made. The NP Companion project 
                         is an ongoing collaboration with the Michigan School of Nursing.</p>

                <h2 >Challenges</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>How do we provide mentorship in an engaging, low-effort way that fits into their busy schedules?</li>
                    <li>How do we ensure clarity in the app's content and navigation?</li>
                    <li>How do we develop a cost-effective solution given the client's limited budget?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><strong>The Solution: </strong> NP Companion provides new nurse practitioners (NPs) 
                    with a structured mentorship platform to ease their transition into their careers. 
                    By offering an intuitive, engaging, and resourceful app, it acts as a guidebook that
                     simplifies complex information and reduces cognitive overload.

            <section class="my role">
                <h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>I played a dual role as UX Designer in the initial phases and transitioned into Full-Stack Development during implementation. My responsibilities included:</p>

                    <p><strong>User Research & Wireframing:</strong> <p>
                    <p>To design an intuitive experience that reduces cognitive overload, 
                        we collaborated with an NP student to gather insights from real nurse practitioners. 
                        Through research, we identified key pain points: lack of mentorship, confusing workflows, 
                        and information overload.</p>

                    
                    <p><strong>Prototyping & Usability Testing:</strong> </p>
                    <p>
                    Starting with an existing digital discovery product, we revamped 
                    the entire structure based on user feedback. We focused on creating a clear 
                    information hierarchy, ensuring users immediately understood what the app 
                    offers and how to use it. Additionally, we incorporated engagement loops to 
                    encourage continued app usage.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Bridging UX and Development</strong></p>
                    <p>To ensure a seamless transition from design to development, 
                        we worked closely with the backend team, 
                        aligning design choices with data collection needs while maintaining a user-friendly
                        experience. Every UX decision was crafted to translate effortlessly into the final
                         product.</p>

                    <h2>Final Outcome & Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>Improved Usability  ðŸš€ </strong> - By prioritizing simplicity and clarity, we reduced cognitive overload, making the experience more intuitive. The redesigned platform received <strong>positive feedback</strong> from nurse practitioners.</li>
                        <li><strong>Higher Engagement ðŸ’¡</strong> - Incorporating real NP feedback helped create a <strong>user-centered design</strong> that encouraged continued use rather than one-time visits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Smooth UX-to-Dev Handoff ðŸ”„ </strong> - Close collaboration between design and development ensured an <strong>efficient and accurate</strong> implementation, bridging the gap between UX and development seamlessly.</li>
